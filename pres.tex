\frame{\frametitle{Startups}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Often looking for generalists
	\begin{itemize*}

	\end{itemize*}
	\item Often looking for very polished engineers
	\begin{itemize*}
		\item They won't have much time to train you
	\end{itemize*}
	\item Usually a fast, hectic environment
	\item If you're good at what you do, then you'll actually have more job security than in, say, the financial industry. And in the case that the company does run out of money, you'll have no trouble finding your next gig.
	\item Be prepared to take a salary cut for some significant equity and the chance to learn
